[Known Bugs]
Major Bug where you can skip indefinitely and win the game outright

Enemy damage triggers immediately upon contact with tower
Everything works okay with this bug except for the exploder, 
it triggers its damage twice so a temporary fix is to halve its damage

Enemy gets stuck in attack state without actually attacking when its target quadrant is destroyed.
Something to do with the canStartAttacking boolean.

[Remove On Final Export]
Nothing for now
